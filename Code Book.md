		Code Book for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project
 
Input data

The input data for this project was taken from the data collected in a project named "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" by University degli Studi di Genova in Italy.
The experiments in that project have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each volunteer performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). They captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data

I used the following files as an input data:
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30

Process

The retrieved data was merged into one big set ("test data" and "training data" together) of data. Then I extracted only the measurements on the "mean" and "standard deviation", filtering out all the rest. This partial data was organized and summarized into a tidy data set (the long version) which is the output of this project
Output data
The output data includes one table ("tidydataset.csv") that includes 4 variables (columns) and 180 rows. The following table is a description of the 4 variables.

"1" "subject"	numeric id [1 to 30] for each volunteer participated in original experiments
"2" "activity"	Textual description of the type of activity [1 of 6 types] the volunteer performed 			while the measurements were recorded.
"3" "measure"	Textual description of the specific physical entity [1 of 79] that was measured and 			recorded. (details in the flowing table)
"4" "mean"	A number which is the mean (average) of all the data recorded and normalized [between 			-1 and 1] for every unique combination of measurement, activity and volunteer.

"measure" variable description

The 79 types textual descriptions of the specific physical entity that are shown in the following table has a special template as follows:
t or f (1st letter) = 	't' stands for time recorded data, 'f' stands for data calculated using Fast 		      		Fourier Transform.
BodyAcc = 		body acceleration [physical entity]
BodyGyro = 		body angular velocity [physical entity]
mean or std = 		mean or standard deviation of the data recorded
jerk = 			derived Jerk Signals
X, Y, or Z (last letter) = the direction (axis) in which the data of the physical entity was recorded.
